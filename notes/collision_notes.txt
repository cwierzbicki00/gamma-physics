FOR THROWABLE OBJECTS: 
	collision = edge of sprite (a more perfect shape to round out pixel edges when scaled up)

FOR FLOOR:
	collision = near horizontal or vertical middle of sprite (a line)
	
	Floor should be on a layer behind throwable object
	
FOR RECIPTICLES:
	Layers:
		fg component (no collision)
			v
		collision component (collision = edge of sprite rounded)
			v
		bg component (no collision)

	Special Notes:
		Backboard of basketball hoop needs a vertical line of collision
